# Fortran Quickstart

Following code is a follow-along code from https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart. Introducing syntax, basic data structures, types, procedures, control flow in Fortran. Fortran has been going through a reboot, and started growing in popularity recently. Taking on learning it early on might be a start of an early adoption of a new language that will continue to grow in popularity. And while it is still a gamble, it is good to familiarize yourself with one of the modern predecessors.

> We have finished the first chapter on a long journey of resurrecting Fortran: forming an initial core community of developers and users with enough momentum around the new Fortran website and projects at fortran-lang.org. There is still have a long way to go to, but this was a necessary (although not sufficient) achievement and I feel this was a once in a life time event. The timing was right, we were ready, and we also got lucky.
